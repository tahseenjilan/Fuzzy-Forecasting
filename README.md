# Fuzzy-Forecasting
Fuzzy time series forecasting using AnalyzeTS package in R.
In addition, a short term rolling prediction formula is implemented to make AnalyzeTS useful. 
The numbner of fuzzy sets is set using a heuristic. The number of intervals should be near the Standard deviation of the time series.

Thanks
